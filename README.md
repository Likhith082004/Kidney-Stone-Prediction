🩺 Kidney Stone Classifier — Deep Learning Ultrasound Analysis

This project implements an AI-powered kidney stone classification system using three state-of-the-art deep learning models: VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2.
The system analyzes ultrasound kidney images and classifies them into:

Normal Kidney

Stone Detected

MobileNetV2 is used as the final deployment model due to its high accuracy, lightweight architecture, and fast inference.
